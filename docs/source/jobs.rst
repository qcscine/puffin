Jobs
====

Basic Jobs
----------

All Jobs prepended with ``Scine`` indicate that they are making use of the C++
``module`` interface defined in SCINE. Hence, adding a personal ``module`` with
a custom ``Calculator`` will automatically enable the use of these tasks with
the custom ``module``/``Calculator``.

For more information  about this interface please see the documentation of
SCINE: Core and possibly also SCINE: Utils.
