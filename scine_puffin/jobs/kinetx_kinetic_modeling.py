class KinetxKineticModeling(KineticModelingJob):
    """
    A job that performs the kinetic modeling using KiNetX given a set of reactions and
    an electronic structure model. The reaction rates are calculated from transition
    state theory. The final concentration and the maximum concentration reached
    (for at least a given set of time steps) is added as properties to the centroids
    of each compound. As starting concentrations, the sum of all "start_concentration"
    properties of each structure for the given compounds is used.

    **Order Name**
      ``kinetx_kinetic_modeling``

    **Required Input**
      model :: db.Model
         The electronic structure model to flag the new properties with.

    **Required Settings**
      aggregate_ids :: List[str]
        The aggregate IDs (as strings).
      reaction_ids :: List[str]
        The reaction IDs (as strings).
      aggregate_types :: List[int]
        The aggregate types. 0 for compounds, 1 for flasks.
       lhs_rates :: List[float]
         The reaction rates for the forward reactions.
       rhs_rates :: List[float]
         The reaction rates for the backward reactions.
    **Optional Settings**
      Optional settings are read from the ``settings`` field, which is part of
      any ``Calculation`` stored in a SCINE Database.

      The following options are available:

      time_step ::float
          The integration time step.
      solver :: str
          The name of the numerical differential equation solver. Options are "CashKarp5" (default),
          "ImplicitEuler", and "ExplicitEuler".
      batch_interval :: int
          The numerical integration is done in batches of time steps. After each step the maximum
          concentration for each compound is updated. This is the size of each time-step batch.
      n_batches :: int
          The numerical integration is done in batches of time steps. After each step the maximum
          concentration for each compound is updated. This is the number of time-step batches.
      energy_model_program :: str
          The program with which the electronic structure model should be flagged. Default any.
      convergence :: float
          Stop the numerical integration if the concentrations do not change more than this threshold between
          intervals.
      concentration_label_postfix :: str
          Post fix to the property label. Default "".

    **Required Packages**
      - SCINE: Database (present by default)
      - SCINE: Utils (present by default)
      - SCINE: KiNetX

    **Generated Data**
      If successful (technically and chemically) the following data will be
      generated and added to the database:

      Properties
        The maximum and final concentration, and the vertex flux of each aggregate is added to
        its centroid. The edge flux, forward + backward flux for each reaction is added to the centroid of the first
        aggregate on the reaction's LHS. Note, that the properties are NOT listed in the results to avoid large DB
        documents.
